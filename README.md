# Linear-Regression-at-Codecademy-Python

For this project, we’ll get to work as a data analyst alongside the curriculum team at Codecademy to help us improve the learner experience. While this data is simulated, it is similar to real data that we might want to investigate as Codecademy team members!

We’re imagining that this data was collected as part of an experiment to understand factors that contribute to learner performance on a quiz. The data contains three columns:

1. score: student score on a quiz
2. completed: the number of other content items on Codecademy that the learner has completed prior to this quiz
3. lesson: indicates which lesson the learner took directly before the quiz ('Lesson A' or 'Lesson B')
